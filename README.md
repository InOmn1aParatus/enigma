# Enigma

### This is my repo for Mod-1's final project, "Enigma."

## Self-Assessment

#### Functionality:
My *Enigma* class performs the intended functions and the command line interface works as expected.
I believe this category *meets expectations*.

#### OOP:
I broke my project into logical components and did my best to keep responsibilities where they belonged. I treated the *Enigma* class as an analogue to the *SalesEngine* class from the **Black Thursday** Project. In each class, the methods work together to perform high-level functions.
Overall, I think my project *meets expectations*.

#### Ruby Conventions / Mechanics:
I performed lots of research to get my methods working in ways that adhered to Ruby convention. Some of them I am actually proud of. While some methods are rather complex, they are written in a way that is understandable, and I can explain their functions.
In this category, I believe I have *met expectations*.

#### TDD:
My git history should reveal that I was writing tests before implementing solutions in my code. In instances where I was not, I was experimenting in a REPL environment and bringing in tested code. There are aspects of the code that are not tested (e.g. file IO). There are also methods that gave me some trouble in testing, but my coverage is very high.
Although I had hoped to achieve higher coverage, it seems I have fallen *below expectations* in this category.
